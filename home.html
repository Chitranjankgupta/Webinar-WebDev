                <p><b>Date : </b>21th Aug 2021</p>
                <p>There are several myths and misnomers when it comes to financial planning, and individuals can take in a lot of advice from many good and not-so-good sources. Mistakes can range from confusing high incomes with wealth to not knowing the importance of tax asset placement when choosing your investments. Review these key insights that can lead to a more financially independent life.Most people believe the key to wealth is a high-paying job. Yes, it's easier to amass assets if you have more monthly income, but one key to increasing your net worth is to spend less than you make. Ultimately, spending habits are the reason a professional athlete making $20 million a year can quickly go bankrupt, while a bus driver can retire a multi-millionaire.You need to understand the difference between income and long-term wealth in order to escape the spending trap. Income is an obvious component of wealth, but it's not the only factor.</p>

                <p>A data structure is a specialized format for organizing, processing, retrieving and storing data. There are several basic and advanced types of data structures, all designed to arrange data to suit a specific purpose. Data structures make it easy for users to access and work with the data they need in appropriate ways.In computer science, a data structure is a data organization, management, and storage format that enables efficient access and modification.More precisely, a data structure is a collection of data values, the relationships among them.A data structure is a way of organizing the data so that it can be used efficiently. A data structure is a named location that can be used to store and organize data. And, an algorithm is a collection of steps to solve a particular problem.The data in the data structures are processed by certain operations. The particular data structure chosen largely depends on the frequency of the operation.</p>

            <h3>Operating System</h3>

                <p>An operating system (OS) is system software that manages computer hardware, software resources, and provides common services for computer programs.

                    Time-sharing operating systems schedule tasks for efficient use of the system and may also include accounting software for cost allocation of processor time, mass storage, printing, and other resources.
                    
                    For hardware functions such as input and output and memory allocation, the operating system acts as an intermediary between programs and the computer hardware,[1][2] although the application code is usually executed directly by the hardware and frequently makes system calls to an OS function or is interrupted by it. Operating systems are found on many devices that contain a computer – from cellular phones and video game consoles to web servers and supercomputers.The dominant general-purpose[3] desktop operating system is Microsoft Windows with a market share of around 76.45%. macOS by Apple Inc. is in second place (17.72%), and the varieties of Linux are collectively in third place (1.73%).</p>
